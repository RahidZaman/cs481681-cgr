## Activities

Read the original paper by John C. Hart et al

- [Ray tracing deterministic 3-D fractals](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=74363)
- [Sphere tracing-- a geometric method for the antialiased ray tracing of implicit surfaces](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.87.339&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

1. Investigate signed distance functions on ShaderToy
2. How would we incorporate them into our own ray tracer?

## Graduate Student Activities

1. Trick question: In graphics, for all intensive purposes, what is the difference between Ray Marching, Signed Distance Functions, and Sphere Tracing?
