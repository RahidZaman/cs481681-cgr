## Activities

1. Scavenger hunt: Find photos of these researchers and post them to Slack
2. Explain the three laws that BRDFs must obey to be physically based on Slack. Give examples of what would happen if they were not obeyed.

## Graduate Student Activities

1. Find a classic paper about anisotropic BRDFs
2. Summarize this paper on Slack
