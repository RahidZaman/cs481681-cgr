## YouTube Videos

- [Ray Tracing]()
- [LibXOR Tutorial]()

## Outline

- What is a ray?
- Ray-sphere intersection
- Camera rays
- Whitted Ray Tracing
- Miss shader
- Closest hit shader

## Activities

Feel free to discuss your issues and solutions in the `#rendering` channel on Slack.

1. Implement the ray-sphere intersection algorithm in GLSL
2. How would you test this to make sure it works?
3. How can we create camera rays for each pixel?
4. Find a ray tracer on [ShaderToy](www.shadertoy.com), what is the performance like?

## Graduate Student Activity

1. What are the calculations for computing refraction?
2. Research sky models. Which model is state of the art?
